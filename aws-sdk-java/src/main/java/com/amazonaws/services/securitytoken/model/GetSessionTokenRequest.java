/**
 * Container for the parameters to the {@link com.amazonaws.services.securitytoken.AWSSecurityTokenService#getSessionToken(GetSessionTokenRequest) GetSessionToken operation}.
 * <p>
 * Returns a set of temporary credentials for an AWS account or IAM user. The credentials consist of an access key ID, a secret access key, and a
 * security token. Typically, you use <code>GetSessionToken</code> if you want use MFA to protect programmatic calls to specific AWS APIs like Amazon EC2
 * <code>StopInstances</code> . MFA-enabled IAM users would need to call <code>GetSessionToken</code> and submit an MFA code that is associated with
 * their MFA device. Using the temporary security credentials that are returned from the call, IAM users can then make programmatic calls to APIs that
 * require MFA authentication.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The <code>GetSessionToken</code> action must be called by using the long-term AWS security credentials of the AWS account or an IAM user. Credentials
 * that are created by IAM users are valid for the duration that you specify, between 900 seconds (15 minutes) and 129600 seconds (36 hours); credentials
 * that are created by using account credentials have a maximum duration of 3600 seconds (1 hour).
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The permissions that are granted to the federated user are the intersection of the policy that is passed with the <code>GetSessionToken</code>
 * request and policies that are associated with of the entity making the <code>GetSessionToken</code> call.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * For more information about using <code>GetSessionToken</code> to create temporary credentials, go to <a
 * href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/CreatingSessionTokens.html"> Creating Temporary Credentials to Enable Access for IAM Users </a>
 * in <i>Using IAM</i> .
