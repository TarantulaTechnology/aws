/**
 * Container for the parameters to the {@link com.amazonaws.services.securitytoken.AWSSecurityTokenService#assumeRoleWithWebIdentity(AssumeRoleWithWebIdentityRequest) AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity operation}.
 * <p>
 * Returns a set of temporary security credentials for users who have been authenticated in a mobile or web application with a web identity provider,
 * such as Login with Amazon, Facebook, or Google. <code>AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity</code> is an API call that does not require the use of AWS security
 * credentials. Therefore, you can distribute an application (for example, on mobile devices) that requests temporary security credentials without
 * including long-term AWS credentials in the application or by deploying server-based proxy services that use long-term AWS credentials. For more
 * information, see <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/UsingSTS/STSUseCases.html#MobileApplication-KnownProvider"> Creating a Mobile
 * Application with Third-Party Sign-In </a> in <i>AWS Security Token Service</i> .
 * 
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The temporary security credentials consist of an access key ID, a secret access key, and a security token. Applications can use these temporary
 * security credentials to sign calls to AWS service APIs. The credentials are valid for the duration that you specified when calling
 * <code>AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity</code> , which can be from 900 seconds (15 minutes) to 3600 seconds (1 hour). By default, the temporary security
 * credentials are valid for 1 hour.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The temporary security credentials that are returned from the <code>AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity</code> response have the permissions that are
 * associated with the access policy of the role being assumed. You can further restrict the permissions of the temporary security credentials by passing
 * a policy in the request. The resulting permissions are an intersection of the role's access policy and the policy that you passed. These policies and
 * any applicable resource-based policies are evaluated when calls to AWS service APIs are made using the temporary security credentials.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Before your application can call <code>AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity</code> , you must have an identity token from a supported identity provider and
 * create a role that the application can assume. The role that your application assumes must trust the identity provider that is associated with the
 * identity token. In other words, the identity provider must be specified in the role's trust policy. For more information, see <a
 * href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/UsingSTS/CreatingWIF.html"> Creating Temporary Security Credentials for Mobile Apps Using Third-Party
 * Identity Providers </a> .
