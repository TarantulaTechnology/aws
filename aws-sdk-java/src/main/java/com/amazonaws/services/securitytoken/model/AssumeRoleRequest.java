/**
 * Container for the parameters to the {@link com.amazonaws.services.securitytoken.AWSSecurityTokenService#assumeRole(AssumeRoleRequest) AssumeRole operation}.
 * <p>
 * Returns a set of temporary security credentials (consisting of an access key ID, a secret access key, and a security token) that you can use to
 * access AWS resources that you might not normally have access to. Typically, you use <code>AssumeRole</code> for cross-account access or federation.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * For cross-account access, imagine that you own multiple accounts and need to access resources in each account. You could create long-term credentials
 * in each account to access those resources. However, managing all those credentials and remembering which one can access which account can be time
 * consuming. Instead, you can create one set of long-term credentials in one account and then use temporary security credentials to access all the other
 * accounts by assuming roles in those accounts. For more information about roles, see <a
 * href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/WorkingWithRoles.html"> Roles </a> in <i>Using IAM</i> .
 * 
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * For federation, you can, for example, grant single sign-on access to the AWS Management Console. If you already have an identity and authentication
 * system in your corporate network, you don't have to recreate user identities in AWS in order to grant those user identities access to AWS. Instead,
 * after a user has been authenticated, you call <code>AssumeRole</code> (and specify the role with the appropriate permissions) to get temporary
 * security credentials for that user. With those temporary security credentials, you construct a sign-in URL that users can use to access the console.
 * For more information, see <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/UsingSTS/STSUseCases.html"> Scenarios for Granting Temporary Access </a> in
 * <i>AWS Security Token Service</i> .
 * 
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The temporary security credentials are valid for the duration that you specified when calling <code>AssumeRole</code> , which can be from 900 seconds
 * (15 minutes) to 3600 seconds (1 hour). The default is 1 hour.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The temporary security credentials that are returned from the <code>AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity</code> response have the permissions that are
 * associated with the access policy of the role being assumed and any policies that are associated with the AWS resource being accessed. You can further
 * restrict the permissions of the temporary security credentials by passing a policy in the request. The resulting permissions are an intersection of
 * the role's access policy and the policy that you passed. These policies and any applicable resource-based policies are evaluated when calls to AWS
 * service APIs are made using the temporary security credentials.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * To assume a role, your AWS account must be trusted by the role. The trust relationship is defined in the role's trust policy when the IAM role is
 * created. You must also have a policy that allows you to call <code>sts:AssumeRole</code> .
 * 
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <b>Important:</b> You cannot call <code>Assumerole</code> by using AWS account credentials; access will be denied. You must use IAM user credentials
 * or temporary security credentials to call <code>AssumeRole</code> .
 *
