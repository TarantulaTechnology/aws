 * Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) is a web service that provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud. It is designed to make web-scale
 * computing easier for developers.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Amazon EC2's simple web service interface allows you to obtain and configure capacity with minimal friction. It provides you with complete control of
 * your computing resources and lets you run on Amazon's proven computing environment. Amazon EC2 reduces the time required to obtain and boot new server
 * instances to minutes, allowing you to quickly scale capacity, both up and down, as your computing requirements change. Amazon EC2 changes the
 * economics of computing by allowing you to pay only for capacity that you actually use. Amazon EC2 provides developers the tools to build failure
 * resilient applications and isolate themselves from common failure scenarios.

     * must be rebooted, the instance's status will return one of two event
     * codes: <code>system-reboot</code> or <code>instance-reboot</code> .
     * System reboot commonly occurs if certain maintenance or upgrade
     * operations require a reboot of the underlying host that supports an
     * instance. Instance reboot commonly occurs if the instance must be
     * rebooted, rather than the underlying host. Rebooting events include a
     * scheduled start and end time. </li>
     * <li> Scheduled Retirement: When Amazon EC2 determines that an
     * instance must be shut down, the instance's status will return an event
     * code called <code>instance-retirement</code> . Retirement commonly
     * occurs when the underlying host is degraded and must be replaced.
     * Retirement events include a scheduled start and end time. You're also
     * notified by email if one of your instances is set to retiring. The
     * email message indicates when your instance will be permanently
     * retired. </li>
     * 
     * </ul>
     * <p>
     * If your instance is permanently retired, it will not be restarted.
     * You can avoid retirement by manually restarting your instance when its
     * event code is <code>instance-retirement</code> . This ensures that
     * your instance is started on a healthy host.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * <code>DescribeInstanceStatus</code> returns information only for
     * instances in the running state.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * You can filter the results to return information only about instances
     * that match criteria you specify. For example, you could get
     * information about instances in a specific Availability Zone. You can
     * specify multiple values for a filter (e.g., more than one Availability
     * Zone). An instance must match at least one of the specified values for
     * it to be included in the results.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * You can specify multiple filters. An instance must match all the
     * filters for it to be included in the results. If there's no match, no
     * special message is returned; the response is simply empty.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * You can use wildcards with the filter values: <code>*</code> matches
     * zero or more characters, and <code>?</code> matches exactly one
     * character. You can escape special characters using a backslash before
     * the character. For example, a value of <code>\*amazon\?\\</code>

     * instance. Instance reboot commonly occurs if the instance must be
     * rebooted, rather than the underlying host. Rebooting events include a

     * <li> Scheduled Retirement: When Amazon EC2 determines that an
     * instance must be shut down, the instance's status will return an event
     * code called <code>instance-retirement</code> . Retirement commonly
     * occurs when the underlying host is degraded and must be replaced.
     * Retirement events include a scheduled start and end time. You're also
     * notified by email if one of your instances is set to retiring. The

     * retired. </li>
     *

     * <p>
