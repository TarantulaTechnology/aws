 * Deletes a VPN connection. Use this if you want to delete a VPC and all its associated components. Another reason to use this operation is if you
 * believe the tunnel credentials for your VPN connection have been compromised. In that situation, you can delete the VPN connection and create a new
 * one that has new keys, without needing to delete the VPC or VPN gateway. If you create a new VPN connection, you must reconfigure the customer gateway
 * using the new configuration information returned with the new VPN connection ID.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * If you're deleting the VPC and all its associated parts, we recommend you detach the VPN gateway from the VPC and delete the VPC before deleting the
 * VPN connection.
