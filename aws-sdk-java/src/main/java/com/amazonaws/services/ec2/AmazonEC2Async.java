/**
 * Interface for accessing AmazonEC2 asynchronously.
 * Each asynchronous method will return a Java Future object, and users are also allowed
 * to provide a callback handler.
 * <p>
 * Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) is a web service that provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud. It is designed to make web-scale
 * computing easier for developers.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Amazon EC2's simple web service interface allows you to obtain and configure capacity with minimal friction. It provides you with complete control of
 * your computing resources and lets you run on Amazon's proven computing environment. Amazon EC2 reduces the time required to obtain and boot new server
 * instances to minutes, allowing you to quickly scale capacity, both up and down, as your computing requirements change. Amazon EC2 changes the
 * economics of computing by allowing you to pay only for capacity that you actually use. Amazon EC2 provides developers the tools to build failure
 * resilient applications and isolate themselves from common failure scenarios.

     * wildcards). You can specify multiple values for a filter. A Spot
     * Instance request must match at least one of the specified values for
     * it to be included in the results.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * You can specify multiple filters (e.g., the Spot Price is equal to a
     * particular value, and the instance type is <code>m1.small</code> ).
     * The result includes information for a particular request only if it
     * matches all your filters. If there's no match, no special message is
     * returned; the response is simply empty.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * You can use wildcards with the filter values: an asterisk matches
     * zero or more characters, and <code>?</code> matches exactly one
