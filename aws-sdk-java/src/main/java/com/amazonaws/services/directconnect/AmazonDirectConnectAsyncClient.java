/**
 * Asynchronous client for accessing AmazonDirectConnect.
 * All asynchronous calls made using this client are non-blocking. Callers could either
 * process the result and handle the exceptions in the worker thread by providing a callback handler
 * when making the call, or use the returned Future object to check the result of the call in the calling thread.
 * <p>
 * AWS Direct Connect makes it easy to establish a dedicated network connection from your premises to Amazon Web Services (AWS). Using AWS Direct
 * Connect, you can establish private connectivity between AWS and your data center, office, or colocation environment, which in many cases can reduce
 * your network costs, increase bandwidth throughput, and provide a more consistent network experience than Internet-based connections.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The AWS Direct Connect API Reference provides descriptions, syntax, and usage examples for each of the actions and data types for AWS Direct Connect.
 * Use the following links to get started using the <i>AWS Direct Connect API Reference</i> :
