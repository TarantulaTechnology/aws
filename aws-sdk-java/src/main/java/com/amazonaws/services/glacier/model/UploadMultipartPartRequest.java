/**
 * Container for the parameters to the {@link com.amazonaws.services.glacier.AmazonGlacier#uploadMultipartPart(UploadMultipartPartRequest) UploadMultipartPart operation}.
 * <p>
 * This operation uploads a part of an archive. You can upload archive parts in any order. You can also upload them in parallel. You can upload up to
 * 10,000 parts for a multipart upload.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Amazon Glacier rejects your upload part request if any of the following conditions is true:
 * </p>
 * 
 * <ul>
 * <li> <p>
 * <b>SHA256 tree hash does not match</b> To ensure that part data is not corrupted in transmission, you compute a SHA256 tree hash of the part and
 * include it in your request. Upon receiving the part data, Amazon Glacier also computes a SHA256 tree hash. If these hash values don't match, the
 * operation fails. For information about computing a SHA256 tree hash, see <a
 * href="http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/checksum-calculations.html"> Computing Checksums </a> .
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li> <p>
 * <b>Part size does not match</b> The size of each part except the last must match the size specified in the corresponding InitiateMultipartUpload
 * request. The size of the last part must be the same size as, or smaller than, the specified size.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <b>NOTE:</b> If you upload a part whose size is smaller than the part size you specified in your initiate multipart upload request and that part is
 * not the last part, then the upload part request will succeed. However, the subsequent Complete Multipart Upload request will fail.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li> <b>Range does not align</b> The byte range value in the request does not align with the part size specified in the corresponding initiate
 * request. For example, if you specify a part size of 4194304 bytes (4 MB), then 0 to 4194303 bytes (4 MB - 1) and 4194304 (4 MB) to 8388607 (8 MB - 1)
 * are valid part ranges. However, if you set a range value of 2 MB to 6 MB, the range does not align with the part size and the upload will fail. </li>
 * 
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * This operation is idempotent. If you upload the same part multiple times, the data included in the most recent request overwrites the previously
 * uploaded data.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * An AWS account has full permission to perform all operations (actions). However, AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users don't have any
 * permissions by default. You must grant them explicit permission to perform specific actions. For more information, see <a
 * href="http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/using-iam-with-amazon-glacier.html"> Access Control Using AWS Identity and Access
 * Management (IAM) </a> .
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * For conceptual information and underlying REST API, go to <a
 * href="http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/uploading-archive-mpu.html"> Uploading Large Archives in Parts (Multipart Upload)
 * </a> and <a href="http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/api-upload-part.html"> Upload Part </a> in the <i>Amazon Glacier
 * Developer Guide</i> .
