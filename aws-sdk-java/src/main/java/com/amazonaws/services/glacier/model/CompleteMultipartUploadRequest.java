/**
 * Container for the parameters to the {@link com.amazonaws.services.glacier.AmazonGlacier#completeMultipartUpload(CompleteMultipartUploadRequest) CompleteMultipartUpload operation}.
 * <p>
 * You call this operation to inform Amazon Glacier that all the archive parts have been uploaded and that Amazon Glacier can now assemble the archive
 * from the uploaded parts. After assembling and saving the archive to the vault, Amazon Glacier returns the URI path of the newly created archive
 * resource. Using the URI path, you can then access the archive. After you upload an archive, you should save the archive ID returned to retrieve the
 * archive at a later point. You can also get the vault inventory to obtain a list of archive IDs in a vault. For more information, see InitiateJob.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * In the request, you must include the computed SHA256 tree hash of the entire archive you have uploaded. For information about computing a SHA256 tree
 * hash, see <a href="http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/checksum-calculations.html"> Computing Checksums </a> . On the server
 * side, Amazon Glacier also constructs the SHA256 tree hash of the assembled archive. If the values match, Amazon Glacier saves the archive to the
 * vault; otherwise, it returns an error, and the operation fails. The ListParts operation returns a list of parts uploaded for a specific multipart
 * upload. It includes checksum information for each uploaded part that can be used to debug a bad checksum issue.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Additionally, Amazon Glacier also checks for any missing content ranges when assembling the archive, if missing content ranges are found, Amazon
 * Glacier returns an error and the operation fails.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Complete Multipart Upload is an idempotent operation. After your first successful complete multipart upload, if you call the operation again within a
 * short period, the operation will succeed and return the same archive ID. This is useful in the event you experience a network issue that causes an
 * aborted connection or receive a 500 server error, in which case you can repeat your Complete Multipart Upload request and get the same archive ID
 * without creating duplicate archives. Note, however, that after the multipart upload completes, you cannot call the List Parts operation and the
 * multipart upload will not appear in List Multipart Uploads response, even if idempotent complete is possible.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * An AWS account has full permission to perform all operations (actions). However, AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users don't have any
 * permissions by default. You must grant them explicit permission to perform specific actions. For more information, see <a
 * href="http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/using-iam-with-amazon-glacier.html"> Access Control Using AWS Identity and Access
 * Management (IAM) </a> .
 * </p>
