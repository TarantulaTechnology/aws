/**

 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Amazon Glacier is a storage solution for "cold data."
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Amazon Glacier is an extremely low-cost storage service that provides secure, durable, and easy-to-use storage for data backup and archival. With
 * Amazon Glacier, customers can store their data cost effectively for months, years, or decades. Amazon Glacier also enables customers to offload the
 * administrative burdens of operating and scaling storage to AWS, so they don't have to worry about capacity planning, hardware provisioning, data
 * replication, hardware failure and recovery, or time-consuming hardware migrations.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Amazon Glacier is a great storage choice when low storage cost is paramount, your data is rarely retrieved, and retrieval latency of several hours is
 * acceptable. If your application requires fast or frequent access to your data, consider using Amazon S3. For more information, go to <a
 * href="http://aws.amazon.com/s3/"> Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) </a> .
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * You can store any kind of data in any format. There is no maximum limit on the total amount of data you can store in Amazon Glacier.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * If you are a first-time user of Amazon Glacier, we recommend that you begin by reading the following sections in the <i>Amazon Glacier Developer
 * Guide</i> :
 * </p>
 * 
 * <ul>
 * <li> <p>
 * <a href="http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/introduction.html"> What is Amazon Glacier </a> - This section of the Developer
 * Guide describes the underlying data model, the operations it supports, and the AWS SDKs that you can use to interact with the service.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li> <p>
 * <a href="http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/amazon-glacier-getting-started.html"> Getting Started with Amazon Glacier </a> -
 * The Getting Started section walks you through the process of creating a vault, uploading archives, creating jobs to download archives, retrieving the
 * job output, and deleting archives.
 * </p>

     * This operation lists jobs for a vault, including jobs that are
     * in-progress and jobs that have recently finished.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * <b>NOTE:</b> Amazon Glacier retains recently completed jobs for a
     * period before deleting them; however, it eventually removes completed
     * jobs. The output of completed jobs can be retrieved. Retaining
     * completed jobs for a period of time after they have completed enables
     * you to get a job output in the event you miss the job completion
     * notification or your first attempt to download it fails. For example,
     * suppose you start an archive retrieval job to download an archive.
     * After the job completes, you start to download the archive but
     * encounter a network error. In this scenario, you can retry and
     * download the archive while the job exists.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * To retrieve an archive or retrieve a vault inventory from Amazon
     * Glacier, you first initiate a job, and after the job completes, you
     * download the data. For an archive retrieval, the output is the archive
     * data, and for an inventory retrieval, it is the inventory list. The
     * List Job operation returns a list of these jobs sorted by job
     * initiation time.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * This List Jobs operation supports pagination. By default, this
     * operation returns up to 1,000 jobs in the response. You should always
     * check the response for a <code>marker</code> at which to continue the
     * list; if there are no more items the <code>marker</code> is
     * <code>null</code> .
     * To return a list of jobs that begins at a specific job, set
     * the <code>marker</code> request parameter to the value you obtained
     * from a previous List Jobs request. You can also limit the number of
     * jobs returned in the response by specifying the <code>limit</code>
     * parameter in the request.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * Additionally, you can filter the jobs list returned by specifying an
     * optional <code>statuscode</code> (InProgress, Succeeded, or Failed)
     * and <code>completed</code> (true, false) parameter. The
     * <code>statuscode</code> allows you to specify that only jobs that
     * match a specified status are returned. The <code>completed</code>
     * parameter allows you to specify that only jobs in a specific
     * completion state are returned.

     * <p>
     * This operation initiates a job of the specified type. In this release,
     * you can initiate a job to retrieve either an archive or a vault
     * inventory (a list of archives in a vault).
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * Retrieving data from Amazon Glacier is a two-step process:
     * </p>
     * <ol> <li> <p>
     * Initiate a retrieval job.
     * </p>
     * </li>
     * <li> <p>
     * After the job completes, download the bytes.
     * </p>
     * </li>
     * </ol> <p>
     * The retrieval request is executed asynchronously. When you initiate a
     * retrieval job, Amazon Glacier creates a job and returns a job ID in
     * the response. When Amazon Glacier completes the job, you can get the
     * job output (archive or inventory data). For information about getting
     * job output, see GetJobOutput operation.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * The job must complete before you can get its output. To determine when
     * a job is complete, you have the following options:
     * </p>
     * 
     * <ul>
     * <li> <p>
     * <b>Use Amazon SNS Notification</b> You can specify an Amazon Simple
     * Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic to which Amazon Glacier can
     * post a notification after the job is completed. You can specify an SNS
     * topic per job request. The notification is sent only after Amazon
     * Glacier completes the job. In addition to specifying an SNS topic per
     * job request, you can configure vault notifications for a vault so that
     * job notifications are always sent. For more information, see
     * SetVaultNotificationConfiguration.
     * </p>
     * </li>
     * <li> <p>
     * <b>Get job details</b> You can make a DescribeJob request to obtain
     * job status information while a job is in progress. However, it is more
     * efficient to use an Amazon SNS notification to determine when a job is
     * complete.
     * </p>
     * </li>
     * 
     * </ul>
     * <p>
     * <b>NOTE:</b> The information you get via notification is same that you
     * get by calling DescribeJob.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * If for a specific event, you add both the notification configuration
     * on the vault and also specify an SNS topic in your initiate job
     * request, Amazon Glacier sends both notifications. For more
     * information, see SetVaultNotificationConfiguration.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * An AWS account has full permission to perform all operations
     * (actions). However, AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users
     * don't have any permissions by default. You must grant them explicit
     * permission to perform specific actions. For more information, see <a

     * Access Control Using AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) </a> .
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * <b>About the Vault Inventory</b>
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * Amazon Glacier prepares an inventory for each vault periodically,
     * every 24 hours. When you initiate a job for a vault inventory, Amazon
     * Glacier returns the last inventory for the vault. The inventory data
     * you get might be up to a day or two days old. Also, the initiate
     * inventory job might take some time to complete before you can download
     * the vault inventory. So you do not want to retrieve a vault inventory
     * for each vault operation. However, in some scenarios, you might find
     * the vault inventory useful. For example, when you upload an archive,
     * you can provide an archive description but not an archive name. Amazon
     * Glacier provides you a unique archive ID, an opaque string of
     * characters. So, you might maintain your own database that maps archive
     * names to their corresponding Amazon Glacier assigned archive IDs. You
     * might find the vault inventory useful in the event you need to
     * reconcile information in your database with the actual vault
     * inventory.
