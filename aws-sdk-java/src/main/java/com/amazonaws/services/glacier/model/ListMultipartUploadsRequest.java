/**
 * Container for the parameters to the {@link com.amazonaws.services.glacier.AmazonGlacier#listMultipartUploads(ListMultipartUploadsRequest) ListMultipartUploads operation}.
 * <p>
 * This operation lists in-progress multipart uploads for the specified vault. An in-progress multipart upload is a multipart upload that has been
 * initiated by an InitiateMultipartUpload request, but has not yet been completed or aborted. The list returned in the List Multipart Upload response
 * has no guaranteed order.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The List Multipart Uploads operation supports pagination. By default, this operation returns up to 1,000 multipart uploads in the response. You should
 * always check the response for a <code>marker</code> at which to continue the list; if there are no more items the <code>marker</code> is
 * <code>null</code> .
 * To return a list of multipart uploads that begins at a specific upload, set the <code>marker</code> request parameter to the value you obtained
 * from a previous List Multipart Upload request. You can also limit the number of uploads returned in the response by specifying the <code>limit</code>
 * parameter in the request.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Note the difference between this operation and listing parts (ListParts). The List Multipart Uploads operation lists all multipart uploads for a vault
 * and does not require a multipart upload ID. The List Parts operation requires a multipart upload ID since parts are associated with a single upload.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * An AWS account has full permission to perform all operations (actions). However, AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users don't have any
 * permissions by default. You must grant them explicit permission to perform specific actions. For more information, see <a
 * href="http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/using-iam-with-amazon-glacier.html"> Access Control Using AWS Identity and Access
 * Management (IAM) </a> .
