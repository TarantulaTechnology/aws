/**
 * Container for the parameters to the {@link com.amazonaws.services.glacier.AmazonGlacier#listParts(ListPartsRequest) ListParts operation}.
 * <p>
 * This operation lists the parts of an archive that have been uploaded in a specific multipart upload. You can make this request at any time during an
 * in-progress multipart upload before you complete the upload (see CompleteMultipartUpload. List Parts returns an error for completed uploads. The list
 * returned in the List Parts response is sorted by part range.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The List Parts operation supports pagination. By default, this operation returns up to 1,000 uploaded parts in the response. You should always check
 * the response for a <code>marker</code> at which to continue the list; if there are no more items the <code>marker</code> is <code>null</code> .
 * To return a list of parts that begins at a specific part, set the <code>marker</code> request parameter to the value you obtained from a previous
 * List Parts request. You can also limit the number of parts returned in the response by specifying the <code>limit</code> parameter in the request.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * An AWS account has full permission to perform all operations (actions). However, AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users don't have any
 * permissions by default. You must grant them explicit permission to perform specific actions. For more information, see <a
