/**
 * Container for the parameters to the {@link com.amazonaws.services.glacier.AmazonGlacier#deleteVault(DeleteVaultRequest) DeleteVault operation}.
 * <p>
 * This operation deletes a vault. Amazon Glacier will delete a vault only if there are no archives in the vault as of the last inventory and there have
 * been no writes to the vault since the last inventory. If either of these conditions is not satisfied, the vault deletion fails (that is, the vault is
 * not removed) and Amazon Glacier returns an error. You can use DescribeVault to return the number of archives in a vault, and you can use <a
 * href="http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/api-initiate-job-post.html"> Initiate a Job (POST jobs) </a> to initiate a new
 * inventory retrieval for a vault. The inventory contains the archive IDs you use to delete archives using <a
 * href="http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/api-archive-delete.html"> Delete Archive (DELETE archive) </a> .
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This operation is idempotent.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * An AWS account has full permission to perform all operations (actions). However, AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users don't have any
 * permissions by default. You must grant them explicit permission to perform specific actions. For more information, see <a
 * href="http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/using-iam-with-amazon-glacier.html"> Access Control Using AWS Identity and Access
 * Management (IAM) </a> .
