     * record sets. If your hosted zone contains other resource record sets,
     * you must delete them before you can delete your hosted zone. If you
     * try to delete a hosted zone that contains other resource record sets,
     * Route 53 will deny your request with a HostedZoneNotEmpty error. For
     * information about deleting records from your hosted zone, see
     * ChangeResourceRecordSets.
