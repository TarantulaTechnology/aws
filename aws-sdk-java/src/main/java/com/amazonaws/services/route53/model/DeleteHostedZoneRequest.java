/**
 * Container for the parameters to the {@link com.amazonaws.services.route53.AmazonRoute53#deleteHostedZone(DeleteHostedZoneRequest) DeleteHostedZone operation}.
 * <p>
 * This action deletes a hosted zone. To delete a hosted zone, send a <code>DELETE</code> request to the <code>2012-12-12/hostedzone/hosted zone ID
 * </code> resource.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * For more information about deleting a hosted zone, see <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/DeleteHostedZone.html">
 * Deleting a Hosted Zone </a> in the <i>Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide</i> .
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <b>IMPORTANT:</b> You can delete a hosted zone only if there are no resource record sets other than the default SOA record and NS resource record
 * sets. If your hosted zone contains other resource record sets, you must delete them before you can delete your hosted zone. If you try to delete a
 * hosted zone that contains other resource record sets, Route 53 will deny your request with a HostedZoneNotEmpty error. For information about deleting
 * records from your hosted zone, see ChangeResourceRecordSets.
