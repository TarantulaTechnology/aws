 * Container for the parameters to the {@link com.amazonaws.services.route53.AmazonRoute53#createHostedZone(CreateHostedZoneRequest) CreateHostedZone operation}.
 * <p>
 * This action creates a new hosted zone.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * To create a new hosted zone, send a <code>POST</code> request to the <code>2012-12-12/hostedzone</code> resource. The request body must include an XML
 * document with a <code>CreateHostedZoneRequest</code> element. The response returns the <code>CreateHostedZoneResponse</code> element that contains
 * metadata about the hosted zone.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Route 53 automatically creates a default SOA record and four NS records for the zone. The NS records in the hosted zone are the name servers you give
 * your registrar to delegate your domain to. For more information about SOA and NS records, see <a
 * href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/SOA-NSrecords.html"> NS and SOA Records that Route 53 Creates for a Hosted Zone </a>
 * in the <i>Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide</i> .
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * When you create a zone, its initial status is <code>PENDING</code> . This means that it is not yet available on all DNS servers. The status of the
 * zone changes to <code>INSYNC</code> when the NS and SOA records are available on all Route 53 DNS servers.
 * </p>
