     * Add More than 256 Steps to a Job Flow </a> in the <i>Amazon Elastic
     * MapReduce Developer's Guide</i> .
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * A step specifies the location of a JAR file stored either on the
     * master node of the job flow or in Amazon S3. Each step is performed by
     * the main function of the main class of the JAR file. The main class
     * can be specified either in the manifest of the JAR or by using the
     * MainFunction parameter of the step.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * Elastic MapReduce executes each step in the order listed. For a step
     * to be considered complete, the main function must exit with a zero
     * exit code and all Hadoop jobs started while the step was running must
     * have completed and run successfully.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * You can only add steps to a job flow that is in one of the following
     * states: STARTING, BOOTSTRAPPING, RUNNING, or WAITING.

     * <p>
     * For additional protection, you can set the JobFlowInstancesConfig
     * <code>TerminationProtected</code> parameter to <code>TRUE</code> to
     * lock the job flow and prevent it from being terminated by API call,
     * user intervention, or in the event of a job flow error.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * A maximum of 256 steps are allowed in each job flow.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * If your job flow is long-running (such as a Hive data warehouse) or
     * complex, you may require more than 256 steps to process your data. You
     * can bypass the 256-step limitation in various ways, including using
     * the SSH shell to connect to the master node and submitting queries
     * directly to the software running on the master node, such as Hive and
     * Hadoop. For more information on how to do this, go to <a
     * .com/ElasticMapReduce/latest/DeveloperGuide/AddMoreThan256Steps.html">
     * Add More than 256 Steps to a Job Flow </a> in the <i>Amazon Elastic
     * MapReduce Developer's Guide</i> .
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * For long running job flows, we recommend that you periodically store
     * your results.
