/**
 * Interface for accessing AmazonCloudFormation.
 * AWS CloudFormation <p>
 * AWS CloudFormation enables you to create and manage AWS infrastructure deployments predictably and repeatedly. AWS CloudFormation helps you leverage
 * AWS products such as Amazon EC2, EBS, Amazon SNS, ELB, and Auto Scaling to build highly-reliable, highly scalable, cost effective applications without
 * worrying about creating and configuring the underlying the AWS infrastructure.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * With AWS CloudFormation, you declare all of your resources and dependencies in a template file. The template defines a collection of resources as a
 * single unit called a stack. AWS CloudFormation creates and deletes all member resources of the stack together and manages all dependencies between the
 * resources for you.
 * </p>
