/**
 * Interface for accessing AmazonRDS asynchronously.
 * Each asynchronous method will return a Java Future object, and users are also allowed
 * to provide a callback handler.
 * Amazon Relational Database Service <p>
 * Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) is a web service that makes it easier to set up, operate, and scale a relational database in the
 * cloud. It provides cost-efficient, resizable capacity for an industry-standard relational database and manages common database administration tasks,
 * freeing up developers to focus on what makes their applications and businesses unique.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Amazon RDS gives you access to the capabilities of a familiar MySQL or Oracle database server. This means the code, applications, and tools you
 * already use today with your existing MySQL or Oracle databases work with Amazon RDS without modification. Amazon RDS automatically backs up your
 * database and maintains the database software that powers your DB Instance. Amazon RDS is flexible: you can scale your database instance's compute
 * resources and storage capacity to meet your application's demand. As with all Amazon Web Services, there are no up-front investments, and you pay only
 * for the resources you use.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This is the <i>Amazon RDS API Reference</i> . It contains a comprehensive description of all Amazon RDS Query APIs and data types. Note that this API
 * is asynchronous and some actions may require polling to determine when an action has been applied. See the parameter description to determine if a
 * change is applied immediately or on the next instance reboot or during the maintenance window. For more information on Amazon RDS concepts and usage
 * scenarios, go to the <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/"> Amazon RDS User Guide </a> .
