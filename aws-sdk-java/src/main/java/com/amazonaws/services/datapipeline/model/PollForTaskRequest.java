/**
 * Container for the parameters to the {@link com.amazonaws.services.datapipeline.DataPipeline#pollForTask(PollForTaskRequest) PollForTask operation}.
 * <p>
 * Task runners call this action to receive a task to perform from AWS Data Pipeline. The task runner specifies which tasks it can perform by setting a
 * value for the workerGroup parameter of the PollForTask call. The task returned by PollForTask may come from any of the pipelines that match the
 * workerGroup value passed in by the task runner and that was launched using the IAM user credentials specified by the task runner.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * If tasks are ready in the work queue, PollForTask returns a response immediately. If no tasks are available in the queue, PollForTask uses
 * long-polling and holds on to a poll connection for up to a 90 seconds during which time the first newly scheduled task is handed to the task runner.
 * To accomodate this, set the socket timeout in your task runner to 90 seconds. The task runner should not call PollForTask again on the same
 * <code>workerGroup</code> until it receives a response, and this may take up to 90 seconds.
 * </p>
