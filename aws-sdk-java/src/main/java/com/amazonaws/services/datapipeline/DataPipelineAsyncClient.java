/**
 * Asynchronous client for accessing DataPipeline.
 * All asynchronous calls made using this client are non-blocking. Callers could either
 * process the result and handle the exceptions in the worker thread by providing a callback handler
 * when making the call, or use the returned Future object to check the result of the call in the calling thread.
 * <p>
 * This is the <i>AWS Data Pipeline API Reference</i> . This guide provides descriptions and samples of the AWS Data Pipeline API.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * AWS Data Pipeline is a web service that configures and manages a data-driven workflow called a pipeline. AWS Data Pipeline handles the details of
 * scheduling and ensuring that data dependencies are met so your application can focus on processing the data.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The AWS Data Pipeline API implements two main sets of functionality. The first set of actions configure the pipeline in the web service. You call
 * these actions to create a pipeline and define data sources, schedules, dependencies, and the transforms to be performed on the data.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The second set of actions are used by a task runner application that calls the AWS Data Pipeline API to receive the next task ready for processing.
 * The logic for performing the task, such as querying the data, running data analysis, or converting the data from one format to another, is contained
 * within the task runner. The task runner performs the task assigned to it by the web service, reporting progress to the web service as it does so. When
 * the task is done, the task runner reports the final success or failure of the task to the web service.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * AWS Data Pipeline provides an open-source implementation of a task runner called AWS Data Pipeline Task Runner. AWS Data Pipeline Task Runner
 * provides logic for common data management scenarios, such as performing database queries and running data analysis using Amazon Elastic MapReduce
 * (Amazon EMR). You can use AWS Data Pipeline Task Runner as your task runner, or you can write your own task runner to provide custom data management.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The AWS Data Pipeline API uses the Signature Version 4 protocol for signing requests. For more information about how to sign a request with this
 * protocol, see <a href="http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html"> Signature Version 4 Signing Process </a> . In
 * the code examples in this reference, the Signature Version 4 Request parameters are represented as AuthParams.
