/**
 * Container for the parameters to the {@link com.amazonaws.services.datapipeline.DataPipeline#reportTaskProgress(ReportTaskProgressRequest) ReportTaskProgress operation}.
 * <p>
 * Updates the AWS Data Pipeline service on the progress of the calling task runner. When the task runner is assigned a task, it should call
 * ReportTaskProgress to acknowledge that it has the task within 2 minutes. If the web service does not recieve this acknowledgement within the 2 minute
 * window, it will assign the task in a subsequent PollForTask call. After this initial acknowledgement, the task runner only needs to report progress
 * every 15 minutes to maintain its ownership of the task. You can change this reporting time from 15 minutes by specifying a
 * <code>reportProgressTimeout</code> field in your pipeline. If a task runner does not report its status after 5 minutes, AWS Data Pipeline will assume
 * that the task runner is unable to process the task and will reassign the task in a subsequent response to PollForTask. task runners should call
 * ReportTaskProgress every 60 seconds.
 * </p>
