 * Asynchronous client for accessing AWSSecurityTokenService.

 * The AWS Security Token Service is a web service that enables you to request temporary, limited-privilege credentials for AWS Identity and Access
 * Management (IAM) users or for users that you authenticate (federated users). This guide provides descriptions of the AWS Security Token Service API.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * For more detailed information about using this service, go to <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UsingSTS/Welcome.html"> Using Temporary
 * Security Credentials </a> .

    /**

     * Returns a set of temporary security credentials (consisting of an
     * access key ID, a secret access key, and a security token) that you can
     * use to access AWS resources that you might not normally have access
     * to. Typically, you use <code>AssumeRole</code> for cross-account
     * access or federation.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * For cross-account access, imagine that you own multiple accounts and
     * need to access resources in each account. You could create long-term
     * credentials in each account to access those resources. However,
     * managing all those credentials and remembering which one can access
     * which account can be time consuming. Instead, you can create one set
     * of long-term credentials in one account and then use temporary
     * security credentials to access all the other accounts by assuming
     * roles in those accounts. For more information about roles, see <a
     * ttp://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/WorkingWithRoles.html">
     * Roles </a> in <i>Using IAM</i> .
     * 
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * For federation, you can, for example, grant single sign-on access to
     * the AWS Management Console. If you already have an identity and
     * authentication system in your corporate network, you don't have to
     * recreate user identities in AWS in order to grant those user
     * identities access to AWS. Instead, after a user has been
     * authenticated, you call <code>AssumeRole</code> (and specify the role
     * with the appropriate permissions) to get temporary security
     * credentials for that user. With those temporary security credentials,
     * you construct a sign-in URL that users can use to access the console.
     * For more information, see <a
     * ref="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/UsingSTS/STSUseCases.html">
     * Scenarios for Granting Temporary Access </a> in <i>AWS Security Token
     * Service</i> .
     * 
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * The temporary security credentials are valid for the duration that
     * you specified when calling <code>AssumeRole</code> , which can be from
     * 900 seconds (15 minutes) to 3600 seconds (1 hour). The default is 1
     * hour.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * The temporary security credentials that are returned from the
     * <code>AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity</code> response have the permissions
     * that are associated with the access policy of the role being assumed
     * and any policies that are associated with the AWS resource being
     * accessed. You can further restrict the permissions of the temporary
     * security credentials by passing a policy in the request. The resulting
     * permissions are an intersection of the role's access policy and the
     * policy that you passed. These policies and any applicable
     * resource-based policies are evaluated when calls to AWS service APIs
     * are made using the temporary security credentials.
