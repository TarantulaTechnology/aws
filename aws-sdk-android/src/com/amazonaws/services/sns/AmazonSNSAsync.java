/**
 * Interface for accessing AmazonSNS asynchronously.
 * Each asynchronous method will return a Java Future object, and users are also allowed
 * to provide a callback handler.
 * Amazon Simple Notification Service <p>
 * Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) is a web service that enables you to build distributed web-enabled applications. Applications can use
 * Amazon SNS to easily push real-time notification messages to interested subscribers over multiple delivery protocols. For more information about this
 * product see <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/sns/"> http://aws.amazon.com/sns </a> . For detailed information about Amazon SNS features and their
 * associated API calls, see the <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/"> Amazon SNS Developer Guide </a> .
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * We also provide SDKs that enable you to access Amazon SNS from your preferred programming language. The SDKs contain functionality that automatically
 * takes care of tasks such as: cryptographically signing your service requests, retrying requests, and handling error responses. For a list of available
 * SDKs, go to <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/tools/"> Tools for Amazon Web Services </a> .
