/**
 * Asynchronous client for accessing AmazonEC2.
 * All asynchronous calls made using this client are non-blocking. Callers could either
 * process the result and handle the exceptions in the worker thread by providing a callback handler
 * when making the call, or use the returned Future object to check the result of the call in the calling thread.
 * Amazon EC2 <p>
 * Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) is a web service that provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud. It is designed to make web-scale
 * computing easier for developers.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Amazon EC2's simple web service interface allows you to obtain and configure capacity with minimal friction. It provides you with complete control of
 * your computing resources and lets you run on Amazon's proven computing environment. Amazon EC2 reduces the time required to obtain and boot new server
 * instances to minutes, allowing you to quickly scale capacity, both up and down, as your computing requirements change. Amazon EC2 changes the
 * economics of computing by allowing you to pay only for capacity that you actually use. Amazon EC2 provides developers the tools to build failure
 * resilient applications and isolate themselves from common failure scenarios.
 * </p>

     * The RunInstances operation launches a specified number of instances.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * If Amazon EC2 cannot launch the minimum number AMIs you request, no
     * instances launch. If there is insufficient capacity to launch the
     * maximum number of AMIs you request, Amazon EC2 launches as many as
     * possible to satisfy the requested maximum values.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * Every instance is launched in a security group. If you do not specify
     * a security group at launch, the instances start in your default
     * security group. For more information on creating security groups, see
     * CreateSecurityGroup.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * An optional instance type can be specified. For information about
     * instance types, see Instance Types.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * You can provide an optional key pair ID for each image in the launch
     * request (for more information, see CreateKeyPair). All instances that
     * are created from images that use this key pair will have access to the
     * associated public key at boot. You can use this key to provide secure
     * access to an instance of an image on a per-instance basis. Amazon EC2
     * public images use this feature to provide secure access without
     * passwords.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * <b>IMPORTANT:</b> Launching public images without a key pair ID will
     * leave them inaccessible. The public key material is made available to
     * the instance at boot time by placing it in the openssh_id.pub file on
     * a logical device that is exposed to the instance as /dev/sda2 (the
     * ephemeral store). The format of this file is suitable for use as an
     * entry within ~/.ssh/authorized_keys (the OpenSSH format). This can be
     * done at boot (e.g., as part of rc.local) allowing for secure access
     * without passwords. Optional user data can be provided in the launch
     * request. All instances that collectively comprise the launch request
     * have access to this data For more information, see Instance Metadata.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * <b>NOTE:</b> If any of the AMIs have a product code attached for which
     * the user has not subscribed, the RunInstances call will fail.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * <b>IMPORTANT:</b> We strongly recommend using the 2.6.18 Xen stock
     * kernel with the c1.medium and c1.xlarge instances. Although the
     * default Amazon EC2 kernels will work, the new kernels provide greater
     * stability and performance for these instance types. For more
     * information about kernels, see Kernels, RAM Disks, and Block Device
     * Mappings.

     * <p>
     * You can filter the results to return information only about Spot
     * Instance requests that match criteria you specify. For example, you
     * could get information about requests where the Spot Price you
     * specified is a certain value (you can't use greater than or less than
     * comparison, but you can use <code>*</code> and <code>?</code>
     * wildcards). You can specify multiple values for a filter. A Spot
     * Instance request must match at least one of the specified values for
     * it to be included in the results.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * You can specify multiple filters (e.g., the Spot Price is equal to a
     * particular value, and the instance type is <code>m1.small</code> ).
     * The result includes information for a particular request only if it
     * matches all your filters. If there's no match, no special message is
     * returned; the response is simply empty.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * You can use wildcards with the filter values: an asterisk matches
     * zero or more characters, and <code>?</code> matches exactly one
     * character. You can escape special characters using a backslash before
     * the character. For example, a value of <code>\*amazon\?\\</code>
     * searches for the literal string <code>*amazon?\</code> .

     * <p>
     * Describes the status of an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2)
     * instance. Instance status provides information about two types of
     * scheduled events for an instance that may require your attention:
     * </p>
     * 
     * <ul>
     * <li> Scheduled Reboot: When Amazon EC2 determines that an instance
     * must be rebooted, the instance's status will return one of two event
     * codes: <code>system-reboot</code> or <code>instance-reboot</code> .
     * System reboot commonly occurs if certain maintenance or upgrade
     * operations require a reboot of the underlying host that supports an
     * instance. Instance reboot commonly occurs if the instance must be
     * rebooted, rather than the underlying host. Rebooting events include a
     * scheduled start and end time. </li>
     * <li> Scheduled Retirement: When Amazon EC2 determines that an
     * instance must be shut down, the instance's status will return an event
     * code called <code>instance-retirement</code> . Retirement commonly
     * occurs when the underlying host is degraded and must be replaced.
     * Retirement events include a scheduled start and end time. You're also
     * notified by email if one of your instances is set to retiring. The
     * email message indicates when your instance will be permanently
     * retired. </li>
     * 
     * </ul>
     * <p>
     * If your instance is permanently retired, it will not be restarted.
     * You can avoid retirement by manually restarting your instance when its
     * event code is <code>instance-retirement</code> . This ensures that
     * your instance is started on a healthy host.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * <code>DescribeInstanceStatus</code> returns information only for
     * instances in the running state.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * You can filter the results to return information only about instances
     * that match criteria you specify. For example, you could get
     * information about instances in a specific Availability Zone. You can
     * specify multiple values for a filter (e.g., more than one Availability
     * Zone). An instance must match at least one of the specified values for
     * it to be included in the results.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * You can specify multiple filters. An instance must match all the
     * filters for it to be included in the results. If there's no match, no
     * special message is returned; the response is simply empty.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * You can use wildcards with the filter values: <code>*</code> matches
     * zero or more characters, and <code>?</code> matches exactly one
     * character. You can escape special characters using a backslash before
     * the character. For example, a value of <code>\*amazon\?\\</code>
