/**
 * Interface for accessing AmazonEC2 asynchronously.
 * Each asynchronous method will return a Java Future object, and users are also allowed
 * to provide a callback handler.
 * Amazon EC2 <p>
 * Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) is a web service that provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud. It is designed to make web-scale
 * computing easier for developers.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Amazon EC2's simple web service interface allows you to obtain and configure capacity with minimal friction. It provides you with complete control of
 * your computing resources and lets you run on Amazon's proven computing environment. Amazon EC2 reduces the time required to obtain and boot new server
 * instances to minutes, allowing you to quickly scale capacity, both up and down, as your computing requirements change. Amazon EC2 changes the
 * economics of computing by allowing you to pay only for capacity that you actually use. Amazon EC2 provides developers the tools to build failure
 * resilient applications and isolate themselves from common failure scenarios.

     * codes: <code>system-reboot</code> or <code>instance-reboot</code> .
     * System reboot commonly occurs if certain maintenance or upgrade
     * operations require a reboot of the underlying host that supports an
     * instance. Instance reboot commonly occurs if the instance must be
     * rebooted, rather than the underlying host. Rebooting events include a
     * scheduled start and end time. </li>
     * <li> Scheduled Retirement: When Amazon EC2 determines that an
     * instance must be shut down, the instance's status will return an event
     * code called <code>instance-retirement</code> . Retirement commonly
     * occurs when the underlying host is degraded and must be replaced.
     * Retirement events include a scheduled start and end time. You're also
     * notified by email if one of your instances is set to retiring. The
     * email message indicates when your instance will be permanently
     * retired. </li>
     * 
     * </ul>
     * <p>
     * If your instance is permanently retired, it will not be restarted.

     * instances in the running state.

     * You can filter the results to return information only about instances
     * that match criteria you specify. For example, you could get
     * information about instances in a specific Availability Zone. You can
     * specify multiple values for a filter (e.g., more than one Availability
     * Zone). An instance must match at least one of the specified values for
